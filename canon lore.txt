canon Github Madness lore:
Sonic was just enjoying his day, but Dr. Eggman had a machine that transported Sonic into a hole of nothing.
What he did not know was he was inside a disassembly that was edited by a lot of people. After 5 days of being in that hole, Sonic already had enough!
Sonic went insane from how trippy everything looked and gained the voice of Charles Martinet, and along the way he found 3 others that were trapped inide the disassembly that also sounded like the guy mentioned.
After that, they heard a mysterious voice saying "Lets add this too the SHC expo!", but they did not know the meaning of that sentence.
When everyone thought Sonic would encounter Dr. Eggman, they instead had a sudden surprise...
A Bubble Dragon called Bubblun, just casually opearting the Egg Mobile for fun!
They don't know about the bubble dragon, where it came from in the first place or his motives, so the protagonists automatically assumed he was Dr. Eggman and kicked his ass.

canon Github Madness (Episode: Bubblun) lore:
Bubblun the Bubble Dragon was playing a game of Bust a Move with his brother Bobblun, but suddenly the wizard Drunk sent them into a hole of nothing.
After being sent into the hole of nothing, Bubblun saw 4 beings who were trapped inside the disassembly.
Bubblun was teleported to near an unused Egg Mobile, he decided to have fun with an unused Egg Mobile.
He didn't have a care in the world, however little would he know he'd be mistaken for a certain villan...
